Assignment 1
============

A general task to do while learning a new language is, of course, to calculate with numbers. Math is cool. Deal with it.

1. Calculate [factorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of numbers sequentially and recursively. As two solutions.
 * Write a recursive method that uses dynamic programming to not calculate the values already calculated before. So basically use a map to look up if you have already calculated a value, if you havenâ€™t then calculate it. Note that this approach can take up a lot of memory so you can play around with that.
2. Calculate [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) sequentially and recursively. As two solutions.
 * Implement a solution using dynamic programming as above.
